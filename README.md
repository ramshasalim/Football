This project is a fun, lightweight experiment created to practice and explore HTML, CSS, and JavaScript by building two interactive mini-games inspired by 
football: “Guess the Player” and the “Barça Quiz.” It features a colorful Blaugrana-themed interface, pixel-art player images, responsive layouts, dynamic DOM updates, and
simple score tracking. The main aim was to try out UI styling, animations, basic game logic, and dynamic content rendering without using any external frameworks—just pure
HTML, CSS, and JS. Anyone can download the project, open index.html or click the above mentioned link, and instantly play both games. It’s a casual, creative project made purely for learning, practice, and fun.
